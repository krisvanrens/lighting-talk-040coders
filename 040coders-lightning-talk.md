## My spaceship is faster!

# :girl:
## No! My spaceship is faster!

# :boy:
## But my spaceship is faster still!

# :girl:
## And my spaceship is faster still still!

# :boy:
## My spaceship is always one hundred faster than yours!

# :girl:
## And my spaceship is always one thousand million faster than yours!

# :rocket:
Ad infinitum :unamused:
